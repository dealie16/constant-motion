# constant-motion

## Background
This is a game with a core concept that you can't stop moving. The idea came from
playing other games and self imposing this concept.

## Controls
**Left Arrow**, **Right Arrow** - speed up and slow down player

**Space** - Jump

**Left Shift** - Switch direction

**p** - Pause

## Cheats
The only cheat is that while paused you can press *n* and the next checkpoint
will be marked as achieved. This will make you respawn at the next checkpoint
after dying.
